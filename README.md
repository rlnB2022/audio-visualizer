# Audio Visualizer

# Project Description

I created this fun project to learn about the canvas and the HTML audio element. I've seen visualizers before and wanted to challenge myself to make one myself. To depict audio playing, I chose a spinning record. To show the audio visualizations, I wanted them to go completely around the record showing different colors as the frequencies changed. Adding a nice background color effect completed the challenge for me. Click the Choose a Song button to find a mp3 to load. Once loaded, click anywhere on the canvas to spin the record and listen to the song.

(I tried to tone down the effect by lowering the opacity, so the background color changes weren't so jarring)

# Technologies Used

This project is created with:

* Canvas
* HTML Audio Element
* HTML 5
* CSS 3
* Javascript
* jsMediaTags - to get the metadata from the mp3

# Problems Faced

* I had to figure out how to draw each item I wanted on the screen, this included arcs, lines and text.

# What I learned

I learned that React is the library that was just made for me. I love it! Firestore databases are amazing. Coming from a SQL background, a noSQL database with documents wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be. Implementing React Redux to manage the state of the app was also not as difficult as I expected, either. At my current job, we used Flux, so it was easy to adapt and learn.

# Takeaways

This was a really fun project to create. I finished working on this project September 26, 2021...late into the night. Deployed on Github Pages.
